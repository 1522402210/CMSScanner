# CMSScanner

The goal of this gem is to provide a quick and easy way to create a CMS/WebSite Scanner by acting like a Framework and providing classes, formatters etc.

## /!\ This gem is currently Experimental /!\

To be able to run the test.rb, the OptParseValidator gem is needed and currently has to be built manually:
```
git clone https://github.com/wpscanteam/OptParseValidator.git
cd OptParseValidator
rake install
```
